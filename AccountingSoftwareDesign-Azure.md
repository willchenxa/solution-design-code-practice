# Accounting Software Design on Azure Cloud

## Overview

**Interviewee:** Can you walk me through the rationale and best practices for each part of this architecture?

**Ideal Interviewer Answer (Azure):**
Designing an accounting software system on Azure requires careful consideration of scalability, security, and reliability. The goal is to ensure that all transactions and payroll data are safely stored, easily accessible, and protected against failures or attacks. Leveraging Azure managed services allows us to focus on business logic while inheriting best-in-class infrastructure and operational practices.

## Architecture Components
**Interviewee:** Why did you choose these components, and how do they work together?

**Ideal Interviewer Answer (Azure):**
- **Frontend:** A web or mobile app provides a user-friendly interface for accountants and employees. It communicates securely with the backend via HTTPS.
- **Backend:** RESTful APIs (using .NET Core or Node.js) run on Azure App Service, Azure Functions, or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and are stateless for easy scaling.
- **Database:** Azure SQL Database (for relational/ACID data) or Cosmos DB (for high scalability and flexible schema) stores transactions and payroll. Azure SQL is ACID-compliant, ideal for financial data; Cosmos DB is chosen for massive scale and low-latency access.
- **Authentication:** Azure Active Directory B2C or Azure AD ensures secure, scalable user management and integrates with SSO and MFA.
- **Storage:** Azure Blob Storage is used for storing receipts, invoices, and other documents, providing durability and lifecycle management.
- **Networking:** Azure Virtual Network isolates resources, Azure Load Balancer or Application Gateway distributes traffic, and Azure API Management manages and secures API endpoints.
- **Monitoring:** Azure Monitor and Application Insights provide observability, alerting, and tracing for troubleshooting and performance tuning.
- **Backup/Recovery:** Automated SQL backups and Blob Storage versioning ensure data can be restored in case of accidental deletion or corruption.

## Possible Issues & Solutions

**Interviewee:** What are the main challenges, and how does this design address them?

### 1. Hotspot (Data Skew)
- **Issue:** Certain accounts or periods may receive disproportionate traffic, causing performance bottlenecks.
- **Solution:**
  - Use partition keys (Cosmos DB) that distribute load evenly.
  - Use table partitioning or sharding in Azure SQL.
  - Use Azure Cache for Redis for frequently accessed data.

**Ideal Interviewer Answer (Azure):**
On Azure, Cosmos DB uses partition keys to distribute data and load. We design partition keys (e.g., AccountId + date) to avoid hotspots. For Azure SQL, we can use table partitioning or sharding. Azure Cache for Redis is used to cache frequent reads and reduce database load.

### 2. Connection Conjunction (Exhaustion)
- **Issue:** Too many concurrent DB connections can exhaust limits, causing failures.
- **Solution:**
  - Use built-in connection pooling (Azure SQL).
  - Use Azure SQL Hyperscale or serverless for auto-scaling connections.
  - Use elastic pools to share resources across databases.

**Ideal Interviewer Answer (Azure):**
Azure SQL Database provides built-in connection pooling and can scale up or out as needed. Azure SQL Hyperscale and serverless options help manage connection limits. Azure also offers SQL Database elastic pools to share resources across databases. Monitoring and limiting connections at the app level is also important.

### 3. High Request Volume
- **Issue:** Sudden spikes in traffic can overwhelm backend or DB.
- **Solution:**
  - Auto-scale backend (App Service, AKS, Functions).
  - Use read replicas (Azure SQL, Cosmos DB) for scaling reads.
  - Implement rate limiting and backoff strategies (API Management).

**Ideal Interviewer Answer (Azure):**
Azure App Service, AKS, and Functions all support auto-scaling to handle spikes. Azure SQL and Cosmos DB can scale out with read replicas or horizontal partitioning. Azure API Management enforces rate limits and throttling. Cosmos DB's auto-scale feature adjusts throughput based on demand.

### 4. Read Replicas
- **Issue:** Replication lag can cause stale reads.
- **Solution:**
  - Use replicas for non-critical or reporting queries.
  - Monitor replication lag (Azure Monitor).
  - Use eventual consistency where possible (Cosmos DB).

**Ideal Interviewer Answer (Azure):**
Azure SQL supports geo-replicas for scaling reads, but replication lag can occur. We use replicas for reporting and analytics, not for critical transactions. Azure Monitor tracks replication lag. Cosmos DB offers tunable consistency levels, so we choose the right level for each use case.

### 5. Data Consistency
- **Issue:** Ensuring transactional integrity for accounting data.
- **Solution:**
  - Use ACID-compliant databases (Azure SQL, Cosmos DB transactional batch).
  - Implement distributed transactions (Service Bus, Event Grid, Saga pattern).

**Ideal Interviewer Answer (Azure):**
Azure SQL Database and Cosmos DB (with transactional batch) provide ACID guarantees. For distributed transactions, we use Azure Service Bus or Event Grid with the Saga pattern. Cosmos DB's multi-document transactions help maintain consistency for NoSQL workloads.

### 6. Resiliency
- **Approach:**
  - Zone-redundant services for SQL, Cosmos DB, and App Service.
  - Automatic failover groups and geo-replication.
  - Retry logic and circuit breakers in app code.

**Ideal Interviewer Answer (Azure):**
Azure provides zone-redundant services for SQL, Cosmos DB, and App Service. Automatic failover groups and geo-replication ensure high availability. Application code uses retries and circuit breakers to handle transient errors. Azure Traffic Manager can route traffic during regional outages.

### 7. Reliability
- **Approach:**
  - Automated backups and point-in-time restore (SQL, Cosmos DB).
  - Health checks and auto-healing (App Service, AKS).
  - Monitoring and alerting (Azure Monitor, Log Analytics).

**Ideal Interviewer Answer (Azure):**
Azure SQL and Cosmos DB offer automated backups and point-in-time restore. Azure App Service and AKS have built-in health checks and auto-healing. Azure Monitor and Log Analytics provide real-time monitoring and alerting for all resources.

### 8. Scaling
- **Approach:**
  - Horizontal scaling for stateless services (App Service, AKS, Functions).
  - Use Cosmos DB and Azure SQL for seamless scaling with partitioning, sharding, and replicas.
  - Use Azure Blob Storage for unstructured data.

**Ideal Interviewer Answer (Azure):**
Azure App Service, AKS, and Functions scale out stateless services. Cosmos DB and Azure SQL scale with partitioning, sharding, and replicas. Azure Blob Storage handles unstructured data and scales automatically.

## Best Practices
**Interviewee:** What best practices are most important for this solution?

**Ideal Interviewer Answer (Azure):**
- Encrypt data at rest (Azure Key Vault, Storage Service Encryption) and in transit (TLS).
- Use managed identities and RBAC for least privilege.
- Regularly test backup and restore.
- Monitor costs with Azure Cost Management.
- Use infrastructure as code (ARM templates, Bicep, Terraform).
