# Accounting Software Design on AWS Cloud

## Overview

**Interviewee:** Can you walk me through the rationale and best practices for each part of this architecture?

**Ideal Interviewer Answer:**

Designing an accounting software system on AWS requires careful consideration of scalability, security, and reliability. The goal is to ensure that all transactions and payroll data are safely stored, easily accessible, and protected against failures or attacks. Leveraging AWS managed services allows us to focus on business logic while inheriting best-in-class infrastructure and operational practices.

## Architecture Components
**Interviewee:** Why did you choose these components, and how do they work together?

**Ideal Interviewer Answer:**
- **Frontend:** A web or mobile app provides a user-friendly interface for accountants and employees. It communicates securely with the backend via HTTPS.
- **Backend:** RESTful APIs (using .NET Core or Node.js) handle business logic, validation, and orchestrate data access. They are stateless, enabling easy scaling.
- **Database:** AWS RDS (for relational data) or DynamoDB (for high scalability and flexible schema) stores transactions and payroll. RDS is ACID-compliant, ideal for financial data; DynamoDB is chosen for massive scale and low-latency access.
- **Authentication:** AWS Cognito or IAM ensures secure, scalable user management and integrates with SSO and MFA.
- **Storage:** S3 is used for storing receipts, invoices, and other documents, providing durability and lifecycle management.
- **Networking:** VPC isolates resources, Load Balancer distributes traffic, and API Gateway manages and secures API endpoints.
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch and X-Ray provide observability, alerting, and tracing for troubleshooting and performance tuning.
- **Backup/Recovery:** Automated RDS snapshots and S3 versioning ensure data can be restored in case of accidental deletion or corruption.

## Possible Issues & Solutions

**Interviewee:** What are the main challenges, and how does this design address them?

**Ideal Interviewer Answer:**

### 1. Hotspot (Data Skew)
- **Issue:** Certain accounts or periods may receive disproportionate traffic, causing performance bottlenecks.
- **Solution:**
  - Use partition keys (DynamoDB) that distribute load evenly.
  - Shard data by account, time, or region.
  - Use caching (ElastiCache) for frequently accessed data.

**Ideal Interviewer Answer:**
Hotspots occur when too many requests target the same partition or row. In DynamoDB, we design partition keys (e.g., combining AccountId with a hash or date) to spread data and requests evenly. In RDS, sharding or partitioning tables by account or time period helps. Caching with ElastiCache offloads frequent reads, further reducing pressure on the database.

### 2. Connection Conjunction (Exhaustion)
- **Issue:** Too many concurrent DB connections can exhaust limits, causing failures.
- **Solution:**
  - Use connection pooling (e.g., RDS Proxy).
  - Limit max connections per app instance.
  - Use serverless DB options (Aurora Serverless) for auto-scaling connections.

**Ideal Interviewer Answer:**
Connection exhaustion is common in cloud-native apps with many stateless instances. We use RDS Proxy to pool and multiplex connections, reducing the total number needed. Aurora Serverless can automatically scale connections. We also set sensible connection limits in the app and monitor usage to avoid overload.

### 3. High Request Volume
- **Issue:** Sudden spikes in traffic can overwhelm backend or DB.
- **Solution:**
  - Auto-scale backend (ECS/EKS/EC2 Auto Scaling).
  - Use read replicas (RDS) for scaling reads.
  - Implement rate limiting and backoff strategies.

**Ideal Interviewer Answer:**
To handle spikes, we use auto-scaling groups for compute (ECS/EKS/EC2) and read replicas for RDS to distribute read load. API Gateway can enforce rate limits and throttling. For DynamoDB, on-demand mode or provisioned capacity with auto-scaling ensures the table can handle bursts.

### 4. Read Replicas
- **Issue:** Replication lag can cause stale reads.
- **Solution:**
  - Use replicas for non-critical or reporting queries.
  - Monitor replication lag and alert on thresholds.
  - Use eventual consistency where possible.

**Ideal Interviewer Answer:**
Read replicas are great for scaling reads, but they can lag behind the primary. We use them for analytics or reporting, not for critical transactional reads. Monitoring lag with CloudWatch and alerting if it exceeds thresholds is essential. For some use cases, eventual consistency is acceptable; for others, we always read from the primary.

### 5. Data Consistency
- **Issue:** Ensuring transactional integrity for accounting data.
- **Solution:**
  - Use ACID-compliant databases (RDS, Aurora).
  - Implement distributed transactions if needed.
  - Use DynamoDB transactions for NoSQL.

**Ideal Interviewer Answer:**
Financial data must be accurate and consistent. RDS and Aurora provide ACID guarantees. If we use DynamoDB, we leverage its transaction API for multi-item atomicity. For distributed transactions (e.g., payroll + ledger update), we use the Saga pattern or two-phase commit, but keep them as simple as possible.

### 6. Resiliency
- **Approach:**
  - Multi-AZ deployment for DB and backend.
  - Automatic failover (Aurora, RDS Multi-AZ).
  - Retry logic and circuit breakers in app code.

**Ideal Interviewer Answer:**
Resiliency is built in by deploying databases and compute across multiple Availability Zones. RDS/Aurora Multi-AZ provides automatic failover. The application uses retries with exponential backoff and circuit breakers to gracefully handle transient failures.

### 7. Reliability
- **Approach:**
  - Automated backups and point-in-time recovery.
  - Health checks and auto-healing (ECS/EKS).
  - Monitoring and alerting (CloudWatch).

**Ideal Interviewer Answer:**
Reliability is ensured with automated, regular backups and point-in-time recovery for databases. Compute resources are monitored with health checks and can be automatically replaced if unhealthy. CloudWatch provides real-time monitoring and alerting for all critical metrics.

### 8. Scaling
- **Approach:**
  - Horizontal scaling for stateless services.
  - Use DynamoDB for seamless scaling, or RDS with read replicas and sharding.
  - Use S3 for unstructured data.

**Ideal Interviewer Answer:**
Stateless backend services can be scaled horizontally by adding more instances. DynamoDB scales automatically with demand, while RDS can be scaled with read replicas and sharding for very large datasets. S3 is used for unstructured data and scales virtually without limit.

## Best Practices
**Interviewee:** What best practices are most important for this solution?

**Ideal Interviewer Answer:**
- Always encrypt sensitive data both at rest (KMS, SSE) and in transit (TLS).
- Use IAM roles with least privilege for all services and users.
- Regularly test backup and recovery procedures to ensure you can restore data quickly.
- Continuously monitor costs and optimize resource usage to avoid waste and surprise bills.
- Keep infrastructure as code (e.g., CloudFormation, Terraform) for repeatability and auditability.
